The MCD to TIFF python Jupyter notebook here uses the IMC tools package created by the Boden Miller group https://github.com/BodenmillerGroup/imctools

A panel .csv file is required to label the channeles correctly. See Paneltest.csv file for example layout. File directories pointers that need to be edited before running the code are pointed out with comments.

For reading MCD files directly into python without generating tiff images, the readimc package is more appropriate https://bodenmillergroup.github.io/readimc/
