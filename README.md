# Image Analysis
Collection of useful scripts and python code for mask generation, data extraction and plotting etc. The workflow typically uses the following files in the order below:

**MCD to TIFF:** Jupyter notebook that uses the Bodenmiller lab's IMCtools python package to generate tiff files from a .zip file of IMC data. 

**Cell Mask Generator:** ImageJ macro that takes a highly multiplexed tiff image (such as that generated by Imaging mass cytometry), and walks you through generating a multichannel .tif file where each channel contains a binary image of a single cell. This can be used for masking in automated data extraction on a per-egg basis.

**TIFF to dataframes:** Jupyter notebook that takes multichannel tiffs and uses ImageJ-generated mask files to extract total signal on a per-cell, per-channel basis, saving the data in pandas dataframes.

**Quality Control:** Jupyter notebooks for exploring and checking quality of post-masking images to ensure data extraction is not capturing non-specific signal. _Interactive Plotting_ notebook takes tiff images and masks, plus the long dataframe generated by _TIFF to dataframes_, and produces an interactive graph displaying the cell each datapoint refers to on hover.
