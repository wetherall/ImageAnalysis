# ImageJScripts
Collection of useful scripts for image analysis, mask generation etc.

**Cell Mask Generator:** ImageJ macro that takes a highly multiplexed tiff image (such as that generated by Imaging mass cytometry), and walks you through generating a multichannel .tif file where each channel contains a binary image of a single cell. This can be used for masking in automated data extraction on a per-egg basis.
